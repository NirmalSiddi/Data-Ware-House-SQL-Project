![data_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e79ed2e-729a-4a79-a9db-b28c70ae3447)


This project leverages the **Medallion Architecture** composed of three layers:
- **Bronze Layer:**  
  Stores raw data as-is from the source systems by ingesting CSV files into the SQL Server database.
- **Silver & Gold Layers:**  
  (Implement additional data processing and cleaning stages to transform raw data into valuable insights.)
